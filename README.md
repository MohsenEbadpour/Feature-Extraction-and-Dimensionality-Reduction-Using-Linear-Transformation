# Feature Extraction and Dimensionality Reduction Using Linear Transformation 

This repository contains code for a problem related to feature extraction and dimensionality reduction in pattern recognition. The problem involves transferring features to new subspaces using linear transformations and investigating which transformation is most appropriate for classification purpose.

## Course Information

This problem is related to a *Statistical Pattern Recognition* course taught by Professor Mohammad Rahmati (<rahmati@aut.ac.ir>) in the Computer Engineering department at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) in Tehran, Iran. The course was offered in the Fall of 2021.

## Problem Description

The problem involves downloading the well-known Iris dataset, which contains 3 categories and each sample has 4 features. The goal is to keep two features for classification purposes.

The problem is divided into two parts. In the first part, the distributions for three feature pairs are plotted, and the data in each of the figures is transformed using linear transformations. The transformed data is then plotted in new subspaces, and the appropriate transformation for each distribution is investigated.

In the second part, the distributions for the remaining feature pairs are plotted, and the best linear transformation for each distribution is found using trial and error. The projected data in the new subspaces is then displayed.
